      <id>http://localhost:4000/2023/04/24/a-minimal-shell-nix-example-for-managing-system-dependencies-in-ruby-on-rails-projects</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023/04/24/a-minimal-shell-nix-example-for-managing-system-dependencies-in-ruby-on-rails-projects.html">&lt;p&gt;The other day I was helping someone get started with &lt;a href=&quot;https://nixos.org&quot;&gt;Nix&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to give them the most minimal example of getting up and running with Nix and Ruby on Rails. No &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nmattia/niv&quot;&gt;niv&lt;/a&gt;. No &lt;a href=&quot;https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes&quot;&gt;flakes&lt;/a&gt;. Just a 14 line &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tatey/nix_rails_example/blob/b83b5eafd2d5942fcbca5c81aec85727f9e9c05b/shell.nix&quot;&gt;shell.nix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can think of using Nix to manage system dependencies like we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://bundler.io&quot;&gt;Bundler&lt;/a&gt; to manage application dependencies. Everything can be self contained to the working directory and your future self won’t have to wrangle with different versions of Ruby, Node, or C libraries between projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-1-install-nix&quot;&gt;Step 1: Install nix&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-install-macos&quot;&gt;official installation instructions&lt;/a&gt; on NixOS. It is recommended to use the multi-user installation if you’re on macOS or Linux. It should only take a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-2-clone-the-example-app-and-enter-the-nix-shell&quot;&gt;Step 2: Clone the example app and enter the Nix shell&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clone the example &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tatey/nix_rails_example&quot;&gt;Git repository&lt;/a&gt; and change into the directory&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter the Nix shell by running &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$ nix-shell&lt;/code&gt;. Verify you’re in the Nix shell by running &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$ which ruby&lt;/code&gt; to see if Nix is in the path (E.g. /nix/store/vwa1c708p5447vjkk06f8xfvl66yy1wx-ruby-3.1.4/bin/ruby)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try running the console &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$ ./bin/rails console&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;food-for-thought&quot;&gt;Food for thought&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve only scratched the surface. To make your day-to-day usage more ergonomic consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nix.dev/tutorials/towards-reproducibility-pinning-nixpkgs#pinning-packages-with-urls-inside-a-nix-expression&quot;&gt;Pin&lt;/a&gt; nixpkgs to a specific Git reference to guarantee reproducibility. See an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tatey/nix_rails_example/blob/b83b5eafd2d5942fcbca5c81aec85727f9e9c05b/shell.nix#L4&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://direnv.net&quot;&gt;direnv&lt;/a&gt; to automatically enter the Nix shell when you change directory. You’ll want to hook direnv into your shell. See an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tatey/tatey.com/blob/57294f6d6f57bb017215bd9dc3d1cfcd00cd3603/shell.nix#L14&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thelookoutway/bundler-app-dev-shell&quot;&gt;bundler-app-dev-shell&lt;/a&gt; to isolate gems between directories&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn more about Nix on &lt;a href=&quot;https://zero-to-nix.com&quot;&gt;Zero to Nix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bradparker.com&quot;&gt;Brad Parker&lt;/a&gt; for introducing our team to Nix in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2022/02/28/we-are-hiring-a-product-support-specialist-product-marketer-technical-writer-at-the-lookout-way.html">&lt;p&gt;Hi there, we’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://thelookoutway.com&quot;&gt;The Lookout Way&lt;/a&gt;, and we make Lookout — a SaaS-based care management platform that powers aged care and NDIS service providers to get exceptional outcomes for their clients, families, and support workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelookoutway.com/meet-the-team&quot;&gt;Our team&lt;/a&gt; extracted Lookout from the digital infrastructure we made by running a real, world-class service provider, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fivegoodfriends.com.au&quot;&gt;Five Good Friends&lt;/a&gt;. Lookout has already powered over 1,000,000 hours of support in the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re aiming for a flexible start in April. We’re accepting applications until Monday 7th March  11:59 pm UTC+10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;about-the-job&quot;&gt;About the job&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re carving out a brand new space inside our Product Team to welcome a Product Success Specialist (Like a technically focused Product Marketer, or a product focused Technical Writer). In this newly created role, you’ll help our customers run on Lookout by educating them about both the ‘how’ and ‘why’ of upcoming releases. To date, this has been a side project for our Product Managers, but you will be taking over the reins of Lookout’s canonical reference material and release management. The work is a blend of storytelling, technical writing, and the coordination of making new features generally available to all of our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We maximise our impact by pacing releases into long, eight-week cycles. Product Managers, Engineers, and Designers collaborate to solve problems this cycle while you write about what they solved and beta tested the last cycle. We have a strong writing culture, so you’ll get regular updates from Project Teams as they develop new features, but you’ll also draw insights by interviewing people and trying out beta features for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people will read the reference materials you create. You’ll write one-page announcements, publish guiding support articles, record quick screencasts, wire up timely in-app prompts, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flippercloud.io&quot;&gt;flip the switch to turn features on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our customers will use your reference materials to learn about what’s new or get help with a specific topic. Our Success Team will use your reference material to support customers with adopting features or troubleshooting problems. Our Marketing Team will use your reference materials to proudly tell the world about what we’ve made and how it can help them make progress. Your writing will become representative of our product’s voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you a better idea of the day-to-day, here are some recent examples from our Product Managers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wrote a support article to guide a Care Manager on &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.thelookoutway.com/en/articles/5428601-referrals&quot;&gt;how to make a clinical referral to an Allied Health professional&lt;/a&gt;. We weaved through the underlying philosophy along with instructions and GIFs to make it easy to follow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coordinated turning on our new Auto Contacts feature to be generally available, working alongside the Project Team and one of our Customer Success Specialists. Wrote the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.thelookoutway.com/en/articles/5666820-21-10-01-updates-to-rostering-in-lookout&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;, wired up an in-app prompt, and put out an internal notice to our teams. Kept this feature turned off for a handful of current customers (to allow them time to migrate) but turned it on for everyone else. Coordinated timing to turn it on for the final group of customers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recorded a video of a Finance Manager making a claim using our new Home Care Package accounting feature. Our Marketing Team used the video in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/668512298/095f693e3f&quot;&gt;webinar on the new Improved Payment Arrangements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reorganised our &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.thelookoutway.com&quot;&gt;support articles&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier to browse by topic after consulting with the Success and Sales teams.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wrote a blog post to advocate for our new matching feature titled: &lt;a href=&quot;https://thelookoutway.com/blog/bringing-matching-directly-to-customers&quot;&gt;Bringing matching directly to clients. Why we built it and how it works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com&quot;&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; to collaborate internally and coordinate releases, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so&quot;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt; for our internal reference documentation, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intercom.com&quot;&gt;Intercom&lt;/a&gt; to email customers, wire up-in app prompts, and manage support articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;about-you&quot;&gt;About you&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your favourite part of working on new products is delivering real value to customers. You enjoy interacting with your team and customers in a consultative way. Showcasing technology cross-departmentally and to customers energises you. Applying deep curiosity to new challenges comes naturally, and you persist until you can see the most efficient path to full resolution. You are happiest when you are continually learning. You write exceptionally well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You believe in the collective ownership of the product. We celebrate the highs, and we learn from the lows. We’re kind, honest, and authentic with each other. We invite debate and encourage alternative perspectives, but when we commit, we put our differences aside and see it through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll work remotely from anywhere in Australia as long as you have a solid internet connection and a comfortable setup. We’re already in Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. We have a COVID-safe office in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/179+N+Quay,+Brisbane+City+QLD+4000/@-27.4684525,153.0170302,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6b915a06b7c2c29d:0xc2eedf160f982ed9!8m2!3d-27.4684525!4d153.0192189&quot;&gt;Brisbane CBD&lt;/a&gt;, but you won’t be required to work from there, even after the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have a background in communications, marketing, product, technical writing, or something else entirely. If this opportunity excites you and you think you can do it, please don’t rule yourself out even if you don’t feel you tick every box. We know that women and other people in underrepresented minority groups tend to only apply if they feel they are a perfect match. Don’t self reject! We review all applications blindly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be working with vulnerable people so we require you to complete a National Police Check and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndiscommission.gov.au/node/1236&quot;&gt;NDIS Worker Orientation Module&lt;/a&gt;. You must have the right to work in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;about-our-pay-and-perks&quot;&gt;About our pay and perks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a permanent, full-time position and depending on your skills and experience, we’re prepared to offer you a salary between $100,000 and $130,000 + 10% super, no matter where you live in Australia. You’ll also get a $4,500 budget to pick your laptop, accessories, and display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way we work and the perks we offer are designed to help you live a fulfilling life. Some of us start late, and some of us finish early. Some of us work in big blocks, and some break it up. We overlap for most of the day, and we work a regular week where overtime is a rarity. The work we do is meaningful, and the problems we solve are interesting. We like coming to work and working together, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://thelookoutway.com/meet-the-team&quot;&gt;we’re a group of 40+ people&lt;/a&gt; who are also parents, carers, siblings, friends, students, athletes, and hobbyists with a life away from work too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll get the standard four weeks of paid annual leave and the customary ten days of paid carer’s/sick leave. You’ll also get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wellbeing allowance: An annual $500 wellbeing allowance to spend on anything that betters your life away from work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extra annual leave: +1 day of paid annual leave every year you are with us after your second year so you can take longer holidays.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paid superannuation on parental leave: We will continue to pay your super when you take unpaid parental leave as the primary caregiver, so your super doesn’t miss out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Top-up parental leave: We will pay the difference to your regular salary and parental leave from the Commonwealth Government for four weeks (+2 weeks every year you’re with us) if you’re the primary caregiver, or two weeks if you’re the non-primary caregiver.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employee assistance programme: You can get private and professional counselling at any time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-apply&quot;&gt;How to apply&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please introduce yourself to our team by sending an email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:thelookoutway+k9upgr@emails.readblindly.com&quot;&gt;thelookoutway+k9upgr@emails.readblindly.com&lt;/a&gt;. Tell us a bit about yourself and include your CV. Instead of a cover letter, we would love to hear your answers to these questions in the body of your email:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why are you considering working here and why now?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Would you consider yourself a marketer, a technical writer, a product manager, a communications director, a mix, or something else entirely? Where are you comfortable today and where would you like to learn and grow in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tell us about an experience where you rolled out a new ‘thing’ (It doesn’t have to be from a product role, it doesn’t even have to be a ‘feature’). What did you do to gain knowledge? How did you bring people onboard? What did you do to make it successful?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re trying a new feature for yourself so you can finish writing the new support article. You click a button, but the screen it loads next surprises you. You feel strongly it should load a different screen you know already exists, but your co-worker who is a Product Designer disagrees. What do you next?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A guide to making your favourite meal (Or maybe the only meal you can make?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We put a premium on writing, and we promise to give you our undivided attention. Your email will be anonymised, and mentions of gender, nationality, languages, and places will be redacted so it can be read blindly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re accepting applications until Monday 7th March 11:59 pm UTC+10. You’ll first hear back from us within 10 days of applications closing. We’re actual people reviewing applications so this sustainable timeframe gives everyone a fair chance to be considered. Our hiring process is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Send email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:thelookoutway+k9upgr@emails.readblindly.com&quot;&gt;thelookoutway+k9upgr@emails.readblindly.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first interview is to get acquainted and find alignment with your growth and our company. You’ll have a video call with the Head of Product and one other team member.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The second interview to assess how well we collaborate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Offer, referee checks, and background checks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tatey.com/2020/01/19/starting-a-new-job-on-a-thursday/&quot;&gt;Start on a Thursday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re grateful for your time and looking forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, no recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>http://localhost:4000/2022/01/27/we-are-hiring-product-engineers-ruby-on-rails-at-the-lookout-way</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2022/01/27/we-are-hiring-product-engineers-ruby-on-rails-at-the-lookout-way.html">&lt;p&gt;Hi there, we’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://thelookoutway.com/&quot;&gt;The Lookout Way&lt;/a&gt; and we make Lookout — a care management platform that powers aged care and NDIS service providers to get exceptional outcomes for their clients, families, and support workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelookoutway.com/meet-the-team&quot;&gt;Our team&lt;/a&gt; extracted Lookout from the digital infrastructure we made by running a real, world-class service provider, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fivegoodfriends.com.au/&quot;&gt;Five Good Friends&lt;/a&gt;. Lookout has already powered over 1,000,000 hours of support in the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re aiming for a start date in the next 4 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;about-the-job&quot;&gt;About the job&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be working as a full-stack Ruby on Rails engineer on our platform known as Lookout. We structure our work around projects and you’ll focus on one project at a time. You’ll partner with another engineer and a designer to take a project from pitch through to production. The work is a blend of programming and collaboration on business problems giving you the control to balance delivery and trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We roughly follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/shapeup/webbook&quot;&gt;ShapeUp&lt;/a&gt; so our projects and our projects are paced into &lt;a href=&quot;https://cycles.thelookoutway.net/&quot;&gt;eight-week cycles&lt;/a&gt;. We spend the first six weeks designing and building. We spend the last two weeks tidying up and doing maintenance. Our pitches describe the outcome, not the how, so we lean on your empathy, prowess, and collaboration with the project team to get us there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting people to live well at home is broad so Lookout can be thought of as an integrated suite of tools to enable collaboration and remote monitoring in a client’s home for themselves, their families, workers, and health professionals. To try and give you a better idea of Lookout and the work we do here are some recent examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We built a feedback and broadcasting mechanism we call Must Dos and Should Knows. This mechanism keeps care teams looped in with each other through the CRM and the native apps. We’ve used this a lot during the pandemic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transitioned our frontend from plain HTML/CSS over to ViewComponent and Tailwind CSS by replacing chunks at a time. We made heavy use of feature flagging to minimise changes to users.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Made performance and bug fixes to open source projects we depend on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Used Datadog to narrow in on two of our slowest pages and refactored them to be speedy again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll shape pieces of architecture on the backend with Ruby and you’ll craft delightful interactions on the frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a broad spectrum so we don’t expect you to be deep at both ends. Instead, you’ll be complemented by a team that’s inclusive, kind, and flexible to help you learn and grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web is at the heart of what we do. We take this philosophy through to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/au/app/lookout/id1576631449&quot;&gt;native iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thelookoutapp.android&amp;amp;hl=en_AU&amp;amp;gl=US&quot;&gt;Android apps&lt;/a&gt; too. They feel native, but they’re a hybrid app built on top of the Turbolinks (Upgrading to &lt;a href=&quot;https://turbo.hotwired.dev/&quot;&gt;Turbo&lt;/a&gt; is on the cards!) native adapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our tech stack and processes are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have comprehensive tests and this allows us to do 30+ deploys a week through Buildkite&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We aim to ship software calmly and use processes that allow us to operationalise calm eg. we use zero down time migrations, static analysis to prevent security threats&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heroku, Redis, Postgres, Datadog, Rails, TailwindCSS, StimulusJS, Turbo(links)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;about-you&quot;&gt;About you&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shipping high-quality software lights your fire. You’re a generalist at heart and you take pragmatic steps to move a project forward. You keep sight of the bigger picture, always working toward it and helping others see it too. You’re a great writer and you like writing. Writing is the main way you think and share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You believe in the collective ownership of the product. We celebrate the highs and we learn from the lows. We’re kind, honest, and authentic with each other. We invite debate and we encourage alternative perspectives, but when we commit, we put our differences aside and we see it through. You are autonomous but love deeply collaborating such as pairing with other engineers, prototyping with designers, and exploring the business case with product managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll work remotely from anywhere in Australia as long as you have a solid internet connection and a comfortable setup. We’re already in Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. We do have a COVID-safe office in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/179+N+Quay,+Brisbane+City+QLD+4000/@-27.4684525,153.0170302,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6b915a06b7c2c29d:0xc2eedf160f982ed9!8m2!3d-27.4684525!4d153.0192189&quot;&gt;Brisbane CBD&lt;/a&gt;, but you won’t be required to work from there, even after the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new person is an opportunity for us to bring a different perspective to the team. We are committed to building an inclusive workplace where you can do your best and most rewarding work. We anonymise and redact applications so they can be reviewed fairly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be working with vulnerable people so we require you to complete a National Police Check and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndiscommission.gov.au/node/1236&quot;&gt;NDIS Worker Orientation Module&lt;/a&gt;. You must have the right to work in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;about-our-pay-and-perks&quot;&gt;About our pay and perks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a permanent, full-time position and depending on your skills and experience we’re prepared to offer you a salary up to $140,000 + 10% super, no matter where you live in Australia. You’ll also get a $4,500 budget to pick your laptop, accessories, and display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way we work and the perks we offer are designed to help you live a fulfilling life. Some of us start late and some of us finish early. Some of us work in big blocks and some of us break it up. We overlap for most of the day and we work a regular week where overtime is a rarity. The work we do is meaningful and the problems we solve are interesting. We like coming to work and working together, but we’re 20 people who are also parents, carers, siblings, friends, students, athletes, and hobbyists with a life away from work too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll get the standard four weeks of paid annual leave and the customary ten days of paid carer’s/sick leave. You’ll also get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wellbeing allowance: An annual $500 wellbeing allowance to spend on anything that betters your life away from work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extra annual leave: +1 day of paid annual leave every year you are with us after your second year so you can take longer holidays.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paid superannuation on parental leave: We will continue to pay your super when you take unpaid parental leave as the primary caregiver so your super doesn’t miss out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Top up parental leave: We will pay the difference to your regular salary and parental leave from the Commonwealth Government for 4 weeks (+2 weeks every year you’re with us) if you’re the primary caregiver, or 2 weeks if you’re the non-primary caregiver.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employee assistance programme: You can get private and professional counselling at anytime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Tell us a bit about yourself and include your CV. Instead of a cover letter, we would love to hear your answers to these questions in the body of your email:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why are you considering working at a product company and why now?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Would you consider yourself more of a backend person, more of a frontend person, or a mix of both? Where are you comfortable today and where would you like to learn and grow in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are working on a feature. You feel strongly developing it this way will get a better outcome, but your co-worker who is a Product Manager disagrees. What do you do next?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What do you think are the ingredients for building a high-quality web app? What does quality mean to you and how do you help maintain it over time? Can you share a proud or insightful moment with us as an example?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We put a premium on writing and we promise to give you our undivided attention. Your email will be anonymised and mentions of gender, nationality, languages, and places will be redacted so it can be read blindly and reviewed fairly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <updated>2022-01-07T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/2022/01/07/get-an-inbox-full-of-good-cover-letters</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2022/01/07/get-an-inbox-full-of-good-cover-letters.html">&lt;p&gt;Imagine a job ad you posted has closed. You begin making the shortlist by skimming through submissions. You notice some applicants have written good cover letters, but most just summarised their CVs. You find an interesting applicant so you pause to re-read their submission. You learn about the companies they’ve worked for, but you wonder if their values will add to yours? You learn about the projects they’ve worked on, but you wonder how they make progress happen? You’ve gained perspective on their experience, but you don’t have any perspective on what they’re like to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally you’d seek to understand these characteristics through interviewing, and you should, but leaning entirely on interviewing is exhausting. Shouldn’t the effort of writing and reading cover letters be a way to gain an insightful perspective before interviewing? Why do some people seem good at writing cover letters while others seem to miss? A few years ago I started asking myself these questions. I began to experiment with helping our applicants write good cover letters after seeing this &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.signalvnoise.com/basecamp-is-hiring-customer-support-representatives/&quot;&gt;job ad&lt;/a&gt;. Cover letters which were relevant, insightful and surprising. Cover letters which showed applicants at their best, even if they didn’t have &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learnt you can get an inbox full of good cover letters by letting applicants know what you’d like to see in their cover letters from your job ad. Instead of signing off with “Please introduce yourself by sending your cover letter and CV to…” I tried signing off with “Instead of a cover letter, we’d love to hear your answers to these questions…”. I supplied six, short answer questions which explored motivation, growth, collaboration, and values. These were the characteristics I longed to understand when making the shortlist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you a clearer idea of what I mean here’s an excerpt from a job ad I posted in late 2021 for a Frontend Designer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Introduce yourself to our team by sending an email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:readblindly+f5jni3@emails.readblindly.com&quot;&gt;readblindly+f5jni3@emails.readblindly.com&lt;/a&gt;. Tell us a bit about yourself and include your CV. Instead of a cover letter, we would love to hear your answers to these questions in the body of your email:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Why are you considering working here and why now?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Would you consider yourself more of a frontend developer, more of a UI designer, or a mix of both? Where are you comfortable today and where would you like to learn and grow in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Have you worked with Ruby on Rails before (If not, that’s OK!)? What templating/technologies have you worked with? Which one was your favourite and why?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You are working on a feature. You feel strongly developing it this way will get a better outcome, but your co-worker who is a full-stack Product Engineer disagrees. What do you do next?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What do you think are the ingredients for building a high-quality app? What does quality mean to you and how do you help maintain it over time? Can you share a proud or insightful moment with us as an example?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Do you have a portfolio or screenshots of previous work you can share with us (If not, that’s OK!)? Link? Attachment?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and here’s an excerpt from a job ad I posted in late 2020 for a Product Manager:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Please introduce yourself to our team by sending an email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:readblindly+f5jni3@emails.readblindly.com&quot;&gt;readblindly+f5jni3@emails.readblindly.com&lt;/a&gt; along with your CV. Tell us a bit about yourself and imagine our futures together. We’d also love to hear your answers to these questions:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Why are you considering working here and why now?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In the past, what have you done to gain confidence that the ideas and features being put forward for development are good bets?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Imagine the project team is about to finish an exciting new feature. It has the potential to grow earnings for the organisation that use it, but it will require them to make some tough changes to their internal processes. Working with our marketing and customer relationship teams, what tactic might you use to help the organisation understand and take on the new feature?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Tell us about an experience where an idea that you turned into a feature and shipped ended up being a mistake. What did you learn from that experience and what would you have changed if you could go back in time?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Briefly describe some of the previous roles you’ve had (It does not have to be a product role). What are you are most proud of achieving while in that role? What did you learn that you’ve used in other roles? What would you do differently now if you had that role again?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and here’s an excerpt from a job ad I posted in mid 2020 for an IT Support Specialist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A description of a great support/customer service experience you had recently and what made it great.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A time you taught yourself a new skill to complete a job or project.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A guide to making your favourite meal (Or maybe the only meal you can make?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All job ads I’ve posted since mid 2020 have signed off with questions. Originally they were in addition to the cover letter, but now they’re in lieu of the cover letter. I’ve experimented with asking 3 questions, 5 questions, and 6 questions. I’ve experimented with asking general questions and specific questions. I’ve learnt to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask 5-6 short answer questions. Any less and you don’t get enough breadth. Any more and it’s too time consuming for the applicant to write, and for you to read.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cover a spectrum of characteristics. It doesn’t matter if the questions themselves are general or specific. Spend them wisely and don’t double up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Draw inspiration from recent experience or problems. If it’s an existing job ask someone in the job. If it’s a new job consider the circumstances of how you learnt about the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep questions relevant. Don’t assume you can copy questions from an old job ad for your new job ad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write questions yourself. Don’t leave it to someone else.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emphasise to applicants that you, the hiring manager, who is also a human, will read their submissions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give gratitude to applicants for taking the time to apply, irrespective of your evaluation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to reviewing submissions the first thing you’ll notice is the applicants who read the job ad, and the applicants who didn’t. I decline the applicants who didn’t. The second thing you’ll notice is how comprehensive the cover letters are, and the baseline you now have to compare objectively. I recommend doing a pass on cover letters first to make your initial shortlist, and then go back and do a pass on CVs to make your final shortlist. I weigh cover letters above CVs because of their relevance to the job ad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to interviewing applicants, the experience may feel closer to the second interview. Not quite the second interview because you’ve never met before, but not quite the first interview because you’ve already gained an insightful perspective. I recommend using some of the applicant’s answers to go deeper, especially if they are surprising to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time you post a job ad consider signing off with 5-6 questions and you may get an inbox full of good cover letters. They may help you resolve a tie breaker, or they may help you discover an applicant outside your sphere. Likewise, they may help applicants write more insightfully about themselves. Either way, you’ll be making your shortlist with a more insightful perspective. Feel free to use and mix any of the questions from the above excerpts if they inspire you.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>http://localhost:4000/2022/01/04/how-namestork-evolved-from-an-idea-to-a-tiny-service-over-four-years</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2022/01/04/how-namestork-evolved-from-an-idea-to-a-tiny-service-over-four-years.html">&lt;p&gt;This is the story behind my tiny service, &lt;a href=&quot;https://namestork.app&quot;&gt;Namestork&lt;/a&gt;. It brings nine names to you and your partner’s inbox once a day at a time of your choosing. If you’re looking for a calm way to find the perfect name for your baby consider trying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;idea&quot;&gt;Idea&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017 my partner and I were expecting our second child and we weren’t happy with any of the names we had. We were overwhelmed with scrolling endless A-Z lists. We were tired of putting down each others’ suggestions. We didn’t know if we were having a girl or a boy. Our baby was 6 months away and all we could feel was this pressure to come up with a name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why were we rushing it? We had time on our side. We wanted to move at a slower, calmer pace. That’s when the idea came to us. What if we could get a handful of names delivered to our inbox once a day? A mix of popular and unique names that we could look at in the morning along with our newsletters. We could favourite the names we liked, and if we both favourited the same name, we’d get told about our match. If we didn’t like any of the names, that’s ok, we could calmly move on knowing we’d get more the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began to imagine how the service might work, but I didn’t know if it was going to help us find a baby name. I was determined for it to be a sustainable hobby so I set myself two constraints. The first was to budget my time to a few hours a week. The second was to imagine the least I could get away with, and when I imagined that, I challenged myself to get away with even less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;test-1-whats-it-like-to-get-a-daily-email-with-random-baby-names&quot;&gt;Test #1: What’s it like to get a daily email with random baby names?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I wanted to test was the medium. My plan was to email a list of random baby names once a day, similar to how you might get daily newsletters sent to your inbox. If I could get away with email then I could expirement faster because I wouldn’t need to make native apps for iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat at my computer and typed &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rails new&lt;/code&gt;. I defaulted everything. I used Minitest. I used callbacks. I wrote fat controllers. I was cheating and my progress was flying. After four nights over two weeks I had created a basic service. My partner and I were getting random baby names in our inboxes. We could tap a name to favourite it. We got another email when we had a match. There was no way to sign up or sign in. There was no user interface or customisation. There was no way to stop the emails or see favourites. Just &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tatey/list_of_baby_names&quot;&gt;random baby names from public datasets&lt;/a&gt; I scraped together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My partner and I didn’t get many matches, but when we did, we both knew we had a baby name to talk about over dinner. The matches we got become our shortlist and the random names we were being exposed to widened our perspective. We had heard some of these names before, but we weren’t considering them because they were outside our sphere, so rediscovering them was a delight. We weren’t putting down each other’s suggestions anymore. We weren’t feeling pressure anymore. It was fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;test-2-would-it-work-with-other-people&quot;&gt;Test #2: Would it work with other people?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing I wanted to test was other people using the service. The service was working well for us and we were having fun, but would it work for other people and would they have fun too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed a domain for the web and mail server, but I didn’t want to get stuck here. I quickly registered something a bit long, but completely unambigious: findmeababyname.com. We invited our friends, our co-workers, and anyone we knew who was expecting. To my delight people wanted to try it out so I typed &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rails console&lt;/code&gt; and created a record in the database to sign them up. They found some invalid names like “infant” and “unknown”. They found a bug where the favorite link would sometimes break because of how I expired tokens. Mostly, they told me what they liked, and what they didn’t, and no one wanted to stop the emails. I could see names were being favourited and matches were being made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic service was working, but it would take months before I learned if it helped anyone find a baby name. My next decision was between going deeper on the mechanics or designing the user interface. Given most people seemed satisfied with how the mechanics worked, I opted to polish what was already there over adding new features. I opened Sketch and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/shots/4017603-List-of-baby-name-suggestions-by-Namestork&quot;&gt;designed the daily list of baby name suggestions&lt;/a&gt;. This is the most important screen people landed on it when they favorited a name from their inbox. I didn’t design any more screens in Sketch. With this mock up as inspiration I designed the rest of the user interface straight in HTML and CSS. I like working on nice things and now the service looked nice enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hiatus&quot;&gt;Hiatus&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of 2018 we welcomed our baby into the world and the service had given us a handful of matches. If we had a girl she would have been Willow, but we had a boy, so we named him Hamish (Dean was a close second). It worked! We calmly found a name for our baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service was sending about 50 emails a day, and while it worked for us, taking it to the next level wouldn’t be sustainable at this time in my life. My partner and I had a new human we were responsible for. No one could sign up. There was still a weird bug with expired tokens. The service would need to be maintained and the servers would need to be patched. It wasn’t generating any revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the neat things about sending an email once a day is you already have a way to reach out to people. When I made changes to the service I would place a paragraph at the top to give everyone a heads up. I used this technique to announce my decision to shutdown the service and set the reply-to to my personal email address. I waited until people told me they copied down their shortlists and then I shut the service down and let the domain expire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;test-3-launch-on-product-hunt&quot;&gt;Test #3: Launch on Product Hunt&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2020 I caught up with a friend who had welcomed their second child that year. They shared with me the name they gave their child came from the service. I was chuffed. I was looking to pick up a hobby again so I dusted off the service with the intent to launch publically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks I made it so you could sign up, invite your partner (or not!), stop the emails, change the time of day, and filter based on gender. I wanted to test if people would sign up cold and I wanted to test if they’d sign up knowing the service would be supported by classified ads. I didn’t do the work to put the ads in because I was trying to get away with the least, but I wanted to see if stating it would deter people. This is an excerpt from the home page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We run a single classified ad at the bottom of the daily email. There’s no tracking. There’s no spy pixels. We don’t sell or share any data with the advertiser. The only data the advertiser knows is they’re running an ad on Namestork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had let findmeababyname.com expire so I needed a domain. I didn’t like the old domain and decided to think of something new. I like names that are short, descriptive, and fun. I wanted something people could remember, type into a search engine, and find from the first result. I came up with Namestork, like a stork that brings you baby names. Someone already had the .com which was a bit of a bummer, but undeterred I registered namestork.app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a long time lurker on Product Hunt, but I’ve never posted before. I noticed the posts I usually upvote have a nice logo, impactful description, a few screenshots, and a compelling home page. I thought this would give me the best chance of success so I set out to replicate it. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@tatey/106513613651379845&quot;&gt;bought and customised a stock logo&lt;/a&gt;, decorated some screenshots, wrote an FAQ on the home page, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/namestork&quot;&gt;launched on Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. It didn’t get in the top 10, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@tatey/106539251805874111&quot;&gt;people did sign up&lt;/a&gt;, and at its peak the service was sending about 500 emails a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is to improve the service. I’m sitting on a tonne of feedback and I’ve got a few ideas on how to refine the mechanics, like flitering based on culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is to make the service sustainable. It’s costing me about US$25/m when you factor in the VPS, backups, mail, and monitoring. I’m not convinced people would pay a monthly subscription for the service, so I’d like to expirement with running a single classified ad which doesn’t share data back to the advertiser. I think this could be a good compromise between sustainabilty and privacy. This model is common in other regular emails, like newsletters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to diplomatically find the perfect name for your baby consider trying &lt;a href=&quot;https://namestork.app&quot;&gt;Namestork&lt;/a&gt;. If you have any thoughts, questions, or comments I’d love to hear them. Drop me an email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:tate@tatey.com?subject=Namestork&quot;&gt;tate@tatey.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/11/12/we-are-hiring-a-design-focused-frontend-developer-at-the-lookout-way.html">&lt;p&gt;Hi there, we’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://thelookoutway.com&quot;&gt;The Lookout Way&lt;/a&gt; and we make Lookout — a care management platform that powers aged care and NDIS service providers to get exceptional outcomes for their clients, families, and support workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelookoutway.com/meet-the-team&quot;&gt;Our team&lt;/a&gt; extracted Lookout from the digital infrastructure we made by running a real, world-class service provider, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fivegoodfriends.com.au&quot;&gt;Five Good Friends&lt;/a&gt;. Lookout has already powered over 1,000,000 hours of support in the home and it will power another 40,000 hours of life enhancing support next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re aiming for a flexible start in late Jan or Feb ‘22 and accepting applications until Sunday, 5th December 23:59. We promise to respond within 7 days so we’d love to hear from you! 👋😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;about-the-job&quot;&gt;About the job&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re carving out a brand new space inside our team to welcome a design focused Frontend Developer. You’ll directly improve the experience of our users by working exclusively on the frontend in our Ruby on Rails app known as Lookout. We don’t expect you to have collaborated on Ruby on Rails before, so you’ll get an education budget and pairing with a mentor to help you grow. You’ll be directly supported by our Design Manager and you’ll influence decisions in our Design Guild to proliferate an ergonomic design system which we’ve already begun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We structure our work around projects and focus on one project at a time. You’ll join projects as its designer where you’ll partner with two full-stack engineers and a product manager to take a pitch from conception through to production. The work is a blend of figuring out experiences, laying out user interfaces, crafting components to be wired up, and balancing trade offs with delivery to get good outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We roughly follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/shapeup/webbook&quot;&gt;ShapeUp&lt;/a&gt; so our projects are paced into &lt;a href=&quot;https://cycles.thelookoutway.net&quot;&gt;long, eight week cycles&lt;/a&gt;. We spend the first six weeks figuring out, designing and building. We spend the last two weeks tidying up and doing maintenance. Our pitches describe the outcome, not the how, so we lean on your empathy, prowess, and collaboration with the project team to get us there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web is at the heart of what we do. Yes, you can access our app through a browser, but we take this philosophy through to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/au/app/lookout/id1576631449&quot;&gt;native iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thelookoutapp.android&amp;amp;hl=en_AU&amp;amp;gl=US&quot;&gt;Android apps&lt;/a&gt; too. They feel native, but they’re a hybrid app built on top of the Turbolinks (Upgrading to &lt;a href=&quot;https://turbo.hotwired.dev&quot;&gt;Turbo&lt;/a&gt; is on the cards!) native adapters. The union of native apps on top of a shared, web view is how our team has punched above its weight with fewer people and little overtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting people to live well at home is broad so Lookout can be thought of as an integrated suite of tools to enable collaboration and remote monitoring in a client’s home for themselves, their families, workers, and health professionals. To try and give you a better idea of Lookout and the work we do here are some recent examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We reconcieved how medical referrals should work in our industry to be online, interactive, and vibrant. Both in terms of their visual appeal, and more importantly in their informative impact.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wired up panels and forms inside the Settings area to configure how a service provider makes a claim to the Department of Health for the clients’ home care packages they support.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rebuilt our form and inputs implementation to be highly composable while achieving coherent accessibility and usage across native applications. We did this by looking at our existing patterns and taking advantage of the new slots API in ViewComponent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transitioned our frontend from plain HTML/CSS over to ViewComponent and Tailwind CSS by  replacing chunks at a time. We made heavy use of feature flagging to minimise changes to users. We’re not 100% finished, but we made a tonne of great progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We craft our designs in Figma and we craft our frontend out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/erb/&quot;&gt;ERB&lt;/a&gt;, Tailwind (SCSS in older parts), &lt;a href=&quot;https://stimulus.hotwired.dev&quot;&gt;Stimulus&lt;/a&gt; (jQuery in older parts), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://viewcomponent.org&quot;&gt;ViewComponent&lt;/a&gt;. We automate our build pipeline through Buildkite and we do 30+ deploys a week with zero downtime. We make heavy use of feature flagging to continuously integrate and we lean on linting to set a minimum bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;about-you&quot;&gt;About you&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You consider yourself a bit of a designer, and you’re happy to be in Figma, but you see HTML, CSS as your real canvas. You care deeply about about white space, layouts, and consistency. You’re a generalist at heart and you take pragmatic steps to help our team make progress. You keep sight of the bigger picture, always working toward it, and helping others see it too. You’re a great writer and you like writing. Writing is the main way you think and share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You believe in the collective ownership of product. When you ship a polished feature, we all shipped that feature. When you accidentally write a bug, we all wrote that bug. We celebrate the highs and we learn from the lows. We lean on each other and we look up to each other. We’re kind, honest, and authentic with each other. We invite debate and we encourage alternative perspectives, but when we commit, we put our differences aside and we see it through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll make hundreds of important decisions over the course of a working week. No one will tell you what to do, but you’ll know your goal and we’ll minimise your disruptions. We take the time to think and time to write. We make the time to experiment and the time to share our insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll work remotely from anywhere in Australia as long as you have a solid internet connection and a comfortable setup. We’re already in Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Brisbane. We do have a COVID-safe office in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/179+N+Quay,+Brisbane+City+QLD+4000/@-27.4684525,153.0170302,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6b915a06b7c2c29d:0xc2eedf160f982ed9!8m2!3d-27.4684525!4d153.0192189&quot;&gt;Brisbane CBD&lt;/a&gt;, but you won’t be required to work from there day-to-day, even after the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new person is an opportunity for us to bring a different perspective into the team. We are committed to building an inclusive workplace where you can do your best and most rewarding work. We anonymise and redact applications so they can be reviewed fairly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be working with vulnerable people so we require you to complete a National Police Check and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndiscommission.gov.au/node/1236&quot;&gt;NDIS Worker Orientation Module&lt;/a&gt;. You must have the right to work in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;about-our-pay-and-perks&quot;&gt;About our pay and perks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a permanent, full-time position and depending on your skills and experience we’re prepared to offer you a salary up to $130,000 + 10% super, no matter where you live in Australia. You’ll also get a $4,500 budget to pick a laptop, adapters, and display for your work (Good thing those M1 Macbook Pros just came out!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way we work and the perks we offer are designed to help you live a fulfilling life. Some of us start late and some of us finish early. Some of us work in big blocks and some of us break it up. We overlap for most of the day and we work a regular week where overtime is a rarity. The work we do is meaningful and the problems we solve are interesting. We like coming to work and working together, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivegoodfriends.notion.site/d21f01398db747b7b9009e5e4cfe14e8?v=f2c4122a863f433685933cf0e298607a&quot;&gt;we’re 25 people&lt;/a&gt; who are also parents, carers, siblings, friends, students, athletes, and hobbyists with a life away from work too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;+1 day of paid leave every year you are with us after your second year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We will top up 4 weeks (+ 2 weeks for each year you’re with us) of paid parental leave for the primary caregiver, and two weeks for the non-primary caregiver&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yearly $500 well-being allowance to spend on anything that betters your life away from work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employee assistance program where you can get private and professional counseling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regular 1-on-1s with your supporting manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-apply&quot;&gt;How to apply&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduce yourself to our team by sending an email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:thelookoutway+7adpjz@emails.readblindly.com&quot;&gt;thelookoutway+7adpjz@emails.readblindly.com&lt;/a&gt;. Tell us a bit about yourself and include your CV. Instead of a cover letter, we would love to hear your answers to these questions in the body of your email:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why are you considering working here and why now?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Would you consider yourself more of a frontend developer, more of a UI designer, or a mix of both? Where are you comfortable today and where would you like to learn and grow in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have you worked with Ruby on Rails before (If not, that’s OK!)? What templating/technologies have you worked with? Which one was your favourite and why?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are working on a feature. You feel strongly developing it this way will get a better outcome, but your co-worker who is a full-stack Product Engineer disagrees. What do you do next?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What do you think are the ingredients for building a high-quality app? What does quality mean to you and how do you help maintain it over time? Can you share a proud or insightful moment with us as an example?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you have a portfolio or screenshots of previous work you can share with us (If not, there OK!)? Link? Attachment?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We put a premium on writing and we promise to give you our undivided attention. Your email will be anonymised and mentions of gender, nationality, languages, and places will be redacted so it can be read blindly and reviewed fairly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re accepting applications on a rolling basis until Sunday, 5th Dec 23:59. We’re aiming to respond to candidates within 7 days of applying and to make an offer to the successful candidate within 2 weeks after responding. To give you an idea of how we hire, these are the steps the successful candidate will take:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Send email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:thelookoutway+7adpjz@emails.readblindly.com&quot;&gt;thelookoutway+7adpjz@emails.readblindly.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First interview to get acquainted and find alignment with your growth and our company. A video call with the CTO or Design Manager (~45 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Second interview to assess how well we collaborate. We will pair to understand business intentions and sketch out a plan over a video call with the Design Manager and a full-stack Product Engineer (~60 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Offer, referee checks, and background checks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tatey.com/2020/01/19/starting-a-new-job-on-a-thursday/&quot;&gt;Start on a Thursday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re grateful for your time and looking forward to hearing from you 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, no recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <updated>2020-02-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/2020/02/01/mental-model-of-hill-charts</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/02/01/mental-model-of-hill-charts.html">&lt;p&gt;Hill charts are a simple way to see how a project is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; going. They &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.signalvnoise.com/new-in-basecamp-see-where-projects-really-stand-with-the-hill-chart/&quot;&gt;first appeared in Basecamp 3&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve seen them &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@bryceyork/how-and-why-i-totally-reinvented-our-companys-project-status-reporting-method-9e2b9cfbf805&quot;&gt;used outside of Basecamp too&lt;/a&gt;. What I like most is how they signal where uncertainty exists. Lots of uncertainty early on is to be expected. Lots of uncertainty half way through is super risky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we decided to use hill charts I wanted to shortcut the philosophy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/shapeup&quot;&gt;Shape Up&lt;/a&gt; into a quick reference. Inspired by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://alok.github.io/2019/06/18/mental-model-of-dental-hygiene/&quot;&gt;mental model of dental hygiene&lt;/a&gt; I wrote one for hill charts. With the help of my amazing colleagues we’ve adjusted it few times since then. Here we go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;dots-are-scopes&quot;&gt;Dots are scopes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scopes reflect the meaningful parts of the problem that can be completed independently and in a short period of time — a few days or less. They are bigger than individual todos but much smaller than the whole project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A scope is one thing to design, engineer, and integrate together. It solves part a part of the problem and is represented as a todo list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lifecycle-of-a-scope&quot;&gt;Lifecycle of a scope&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scopes on the left most side have not yet started, but have buy-in from everyone on the project team. Scopes on the right most side are completed. Scopes anywhere in-between are in-flight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scopes are added during the &lt;em&gt;mapping&lt;/em&gt;, or they’re added when we’re &lt;em&gt;doing the work&lt;/em&gt;, or they’re added by &lt;a href=&quot;#splitting-scopes&quot;&gt;splitting scopes&lt;/a&gt; into smaller scopes. Adding scopes is an important because it signals how much work we think is left.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scopes can be renamed. We rename scopes when the current name doesn’t reflect the problem we’re trying to solve. Clear naming is important because it signals our understanding of the goal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scopes can be archived if we feel they’ve become irrelevant or our appetite has gone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scopes can be trashed if we made a mistake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;splitting-scopes&quot;&gt;Splitting scopes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scopes are split when we follow their &lt;a href=&quot;#be-aware-of-curious-smells&quot;&gt;curious smells&lt;/a&gt;. Usually this means the old scope is too big, or we’ve been able to think about the problem in a different way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Split a scope by making a new todolist. Leave a comment that summarises the key decisions from the old scope and leave a link to the old scope too. This gives everyone context to understand the split.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;figuring-things-out&quot;&gt;Figuring things out&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scopes on the left hand side signal ambiguity and uncertainty. The only way to move them up the hill is to &lt;em&gt;do the work&lt;/em&gt; and learn.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is where todos would look like research, wire framing, prototyping, scaffolding, and designing (To the extent that the design is figuring things out. Designing a bunch of assets probably lives in on the right hand side).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scopes move from the far left to the middle of the left hand side by figuring out how it should look and how it should be interacted with.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scopes move from the middle of the left hand side to the top of the hill by figuring out how it should be built. Figuring out could mean some programming to help you gain confidence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scopes may oscillate between these two quartiles as they’re being figured out, but &lt;a href=&quot;#be-aware-of-curious-smells&quot;&gt;be aware of curious smells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;at-the-top-of-the-hill&quot;&gt;At the top of the hill&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scopes at the top of the hill mean we’ve figured it how it will work and how it will be built (e.g. Proof of concept, including programming). It doesn’t mean that we’ve designed every pixel or that we’ve written every line of code. That’s &lt;a href=&quot;#making-things-happen&quot;&gt;making things happen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;making-things-happen&quot;&gt;Making things happen&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scopes on the right hand side signal confidence and clarity. The only way to move forward is to continue &lt;em&gt;doing the work&lt;/em&gt; and polishing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is where todos would look like high fidelity mock ups, integrating components, implementing all the edge cases, adding telemetry, polishing interactions, and tidying up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;check-daily&quot;&gt;Check daily&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask yourself this question: Do you feel comfortable with what’s in-flight for the amount of time you have left? If not, kick off a discussion with the team. Do we need to shift expectations? Do we need to do more hammering?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask yourself this question: Do the other scopes look like what you’d expect? If not, dig further. Don’t wait and leave it to chance. Talking to each other is building clarity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;update-every-1-2-days&quot;&gt;Update every 1-2 days&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Move scopes forward as we do and learn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Move scopes backward as we discover rabbit holes, flawed assumptions, or other setbacks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write a comment that names the scope and why you moved it. This gives everyone context to understand the change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;be-aware-of-curious-smells&quot;&gt;Be aware of curious smells&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scopes which oscillate forward and backward are a curious smell. Do we know what’s expected? Are we working on a flawed assumption? Did we discover a rabbit hole? How can we solve this a different way?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scopes which take a long time to move are a curious smell. Is there a hidden scope? Are we trying to do too much? How can we solve this a different way?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Projects which have many scopes on the far left hand side are a curious smell. Are we moving too fast? Are we focusing on imagined tasks over integration tasks? What’s blocking us from completing other tasks first? How can we hone our focus?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Projects which have many in-flight scopes are a curious smell. Are we doing too much? Is our focus too split? Do we need to archive scopes or move them to the chowder list? Is it a signalling problem?&lt;/li&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/01/19/starting-a-new-job-on-a-thursday.html">&lt;p&gt;Why start a new job on a Monday? Is it because it’s the start of the week? Is it because that’s the way it’s always been done? 6 months ago we switched to starting new people on a Thursday to make their onboarding gentler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a new job can be daunting. It’s not something we do often and each time it’s a little different. There’s people’s names to remember, company jargon to learn, and then there’s figuring how the work gets done. We have a buddy system and handbook to guide new starters, but they told us their first week was mentally exhausting. To a degree this is unavoidable, but could we make it gentler?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our onboarding kit is split into two parts. Part one is learning about the company and core systems we use. Part two is learning about how we do the work and all the systems you need to do your job. We found new starters took 2 days to get through part one, and a few weeks of elapsed time to get through part two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We asked the question “What if we started new people on a Thursday?”. They would get through part one on the Thursday and Friday. They would begin part two on the Monday after having a natural pause on the weekend to refresh. After switching to start new people on a Thursday they told us the weekend was a welcome break in between the two parts. A gentler onboarding.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>http://localhost:4000/2016/11/05/five-good-friends-officially-launches</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2016/11/05/five-good-friends-officially-launches.html">&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fivegoodfriends.com.au&quot;&gt;Five Good Friends&lt;/a&gt; as the CTO. Last Wednesday we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE3NowSABIA&quot;&gt;officially launched&lt;/a&gt; at the St Lucia Bowls Club in Brisbane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my grandad passed away my brother and I became the primary carers for our grandmother. We both have full time jobs and I recently became a dad. We started off by rotating weekly, but after months it became harder and harder. Worse, grandma needed to go to appointments during business hours which meant we took time off work. We organised help at home during the week, but it was quite inflexible and difficult to coordinate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re using apps to order taxis, find tradespeople and book hotels, why can’t we do the same with help at home? If you combine that with trust worthy people providing top notch help then you get Five Good Friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a software engineer who has worked on all sorts of apps, I couldn’t be more proud than I am right now to be working with a great team that is fundamentally changing to the way we help the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

This works great as long as the interface that’s exposed matches the underlying schema. As soon as these diverge it becomes necessary to modify the model or controller to maintain compatibility with the interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications may start out with defining &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#as_json&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#to_xml&lt;/code&gt; in their models in an attempt to keep their controllers skinny. Eventually the model is exposed through multiple resources because of nesting or versioning. The same model is expected to behave differently between interfaces. At this point you have a choice of managing this behaviour in the controller or creating proxy classes and defining &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#as_json&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#to_xml&lt;/code&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you’re defining views in two places. Your HTML views live in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/app/views&lt;/code&gt; and your JSON and XML views live in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/app/models&lt;/code&gt;. You’re using functional and integration tests for your HTML views and unit tests for your JSON and XML views. Why are we treating these views differently?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point you decide to investigate one of the many builder-style libraries. All of them have some sort of DSL for what is ultimately building arrays and hashes and none of them do both XML, JSON and JSONP. Frustrated at the unnecessary complexity I created &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tatey/porth&quot;&gt;Porth&lt;/a&gt; (Plain Old Ruby Template Handler) for Rails. Write your views using plain old Ruby. There’s no need to learn a DSL for building arrays and hashes. Just use Ruby. Views are written once and rendered in JSON(P) or XML based on the requested format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[UPDATE 2022-02-01: I consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/jbuilder&quot;&gt;jbuilder&lt;/a&gt; to be the successor to Porth. Yes, it’s a DSL, but you write at the view layer which was the best insight I got from creating Porth]&lt;/p&gt;</content>
